Bubble Breaker is a free online puzzle game where your task is to clear the entire screen of the colored balls. Someone seems to have put a nice pile of colored blocks on the screen. Fortunately they come in groups of two or more. If you click on one of them, all (directly or indirectly) adjacent bubbles of the same color are resolved. You will have to plan ahead to avoid ending up with a huge stack of individual blocks. Because these will not bring you any points.

Press **START** to play.
