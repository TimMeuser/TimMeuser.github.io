Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. Originally created by Steve Francia in 2013, Hugo has seen a great increase in both features and performance thanks to current lead developer Bjørn Erik Pedersen (since v0.14 in 2015) and other contributors. Hugo is an open source project licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

Being able to generate most websites within seconds (at < 1 ms per page), Hugo is renowned as "The world’s fastest framework for building websites" thanks to not only it being built with Go but also conscientious efforts by its developers to benchmark and increase performance. Its speed and evolving feature set led to a huge increase in its popularity. For example, in July 2015, Netlify began providing Hugo hosting, and in 2017, Smashing Magazine completed its redesign of their website, migrating from WordPress to a JAMstack solution with Hugo.
