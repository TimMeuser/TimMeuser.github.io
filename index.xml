Someone seems to have put a nice pile of colored blocks on the screen. Fortunately they come in groups of two or more. If you click on one of them, all (directly or indirectly) adjacent bubbles of the same color are resolved. You will have to plan ahead to avoid ending up with a huge stack of individual blocks.</description></item><item><title>Snake</title><link>/games/snake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 22:51:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>/games/snake/</guid><description>Not implemented yet.</description></item><item><title>Hugo</title><link>/posts/hugo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 22:51:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/hugo/</guid><description>Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. Originally created by Steve Francia in 2013, Hugo has seen a great increase in both features and performance thanks to current lead developer Bjørn Erik Pedersen (since v0.14 in 2015) and other contributors. Hugo is an open source project licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
Being able to generate most websites within seconds (at &amp;lt; 1 ms per page), Hugo is renowned as &amp;ldquo;The world’s fastest framework for building websites&amp;rdquo; thanks to not only it being built with Go but also conscientious efforts by its developers to benchmark and increase performance.</description></item><item><title>Uni Ulm</title><link>/posts/uni/uni-ulm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 22:51:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/uni/uni-ulm/</guid><description>Ulm University (German: Universität Ulm) is a public university in Ulm, Baden-Württemberg, Germany.
