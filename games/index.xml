Someone seems to have put a nice pile of colored blocks on the screen. Fortunately they come in groups of two or more. If you click on one of them, all (directly or indirectly) adjacent bubbles of the same color are resolved. You will have to plan ahead to avoid ending up with a huge stack of individual blocks.</description></item><item><title>Snake</title><link>/games/snake/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 22:51:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>/games/snake/</guid><description>Not implemented yet.</description></item></channel></rss>
